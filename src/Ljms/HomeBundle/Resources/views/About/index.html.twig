		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>
		Lockport Junior Miss Softball (LJMS) was created in 1972 and has become one of the strongest,
		fastest growing softball organizations in the Chicago land area.
		</p>
		<p>LJMS is a structured organization offering balanced age divisions for girls 5 to 18 years of age.</p>
		<p>
		Unlike other organizations, LJMS is a not for profit sole entity, which means all monies are redirected back into the
		LJMS organization. All participants receive a complete uniform along with many opportunities to participate in league activities.
		</p>
		<p>LJMS believes in a strong family involvement and encourages fun and fundamentals. Safe play and a safe environment
		are also focus points of LJMS. All Coach/Managers attend instructional clinics to assist them with their teachings.
		Each team is staffed with at least one female leader.</p>
		<p>All LJMS adult participants (Coaches, Managers, Umpires, and Executive Board Members)
		are screened through a criminal history check to ensure the safest atmosphere for the girls.
		LJMS is also proud to provide a higher level of competition with the creation of a full time travel team.
		</p>
		<p>The "Lockport Pride" is currently offered at the 10U,11U,12U and 13U levels.</p>
		<p>LJMS encourages you to be part of this historic organization and help build the future
		of girls softball.
